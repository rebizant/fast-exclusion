Example implementation of quick algorithm of getting defined quantity of following elements (after given one ) from the list with a support of removing unwanted elements

Only the initialization of the data structure has complexity dependent on the size of the data ( O(n) where n is size of the initial list). Thanks to using HashMap and tables for data searching and "
deleting" complexity is independent from the quantity of the data.
